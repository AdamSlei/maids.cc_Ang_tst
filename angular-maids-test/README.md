# User Dashboard - Angular Dynamic Application

This project is an interactive user dashboard built with Angular 17, demonstrating advanced features like state management, observables, and caching techniques. It showcases the ability to fetch and display user data from an API, with search functionality and detailed user information pages.

## Features

- **Dynamic User List**: Users are listed with pagination, and their information can be fetched dynamically from the API.
- **Search Functionality**: Search users by ID instantly within the header without requiring a separate button.
- **User Detail View**: Click on any user card to view detailed information.
- **Caching**: Reduces redundant HTTP requests for performance optimization.
- **Loading Bar**: A visual indicator is displayed for pending network requests.

## Project Setup

This project is created using Angular CLI as the foundation.

### Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
